Personality Prediction Using SVM
With over 3.5 million assessments conducted each year, MBTI is the most widely used personality indicator globally. The Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a personality type system that divides everyone into 16 distinct personalities based on four dimensions, namely: Introversion (I) — Extroversion (E), Intuition (N) — Sensing (S), Thinking (T) — Feeling (F), Judging (J) — Perceiving (P). MBTI predicted personality traits retain essential properties of the traditional personality characteristics. Researchers widely use machine learning and deep learning algorithms to predict personality and psychological traits from digital records.
We’re developing an MBTI personality classifier that uses machine learning models to predict a person’s personality based on the 50 recent social media posts per user as input. We find correlations between a person’s MBTI personality type and writing style. The classifier also demonstrates the validity of the MBTI test. We have used a decent amount of mined personality annotated data from social media. Furthermore, our model would run on more data than that provided in a conventional personality test, which serves as a confirmation system and helps people rely more on the results.
